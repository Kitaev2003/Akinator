# Akinator
The famous game "Akinator" on a binary tree.The game is already ready and does not particularly tolerate changes, but you can use some functions. For example,
```
GetDump()
```
or
```
Set Insert(Block_Tree* elem, char* str)
```
To start the game, enter 
```
make
```
in the terminal and immediately after 
```
./start
```
### Good luck to you. Have fun with my Akinator
